# Abstract

This thesis presents the development of a software application designed to assist users in sports betting, with a specific focus on hedging strategies. Hedging in sports betting involves placing bets on multiple outcomes of a single event in a strategic way to guarantee a profit regardless of the final result. The study investigates methods to identify and optimize such opportunities where the total payout is greater than the total amount wagered. The thesis outlines the application's approach to analyzing betting odds, implementing algorithms for identifying profitable betting situations, and integrating a notification system to inform users of these opportunities. This research also includes a historical analysis of sports betting odds to determine the mathematical viability of this strategy. The research combines theoretical exploration with practical application development, aiming to provide a tool that helps users make informed decisions in sports betting. This work contributes to the understanding of sports betting dynamics and offers a practical solution for users seeking to enhance their betting strategies through calculated and informed approaches.
